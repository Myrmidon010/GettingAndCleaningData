CodeBook for TidyActivity_Aggregated.txt Dataset
Author: Sebastian Cruz sebcruz@outlook.com

Tidy Dataset Structure
One record per SubjectID and Activity with each Measure column representing the mean or standard deviation of a specific sensor output.

Variables/Dimensions
Activity - Stores the activities each Subject in the study participated in as the "factor" datatype. Activities include LAYING, SITTING, STANDING, WALKING, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, and WALKING_UPSTAIRS.

SubjectID - 30 participants participated in the study.  Each number, 1 through 30, represents a single individual engaging in the above activities.

Measures
The following measures were captured off each smartphone used by each of the Subjects in the study that performed the Activites descibed above. Per the source project requirements, measures were limited to those with the text "mean()" or "std()" in the field description. These measurements represent the mean or standard deviation for accelleration (standard "g" units) and gyroscopic position (radians/second) recorded by the sensors in the smartphone on three axis X, Y, and Z. The raw data provided included multiple measurements per SubjectID and Activity.  Per the course project requirements, a tidy dataset produced by this analysis summerized each of the measures below using the average operation such that there is one record per SubjectID and Activity.  Each measure below was treated as a float datatype.
